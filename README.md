## Intents

Intents are used to specify which events bot will receive from the Discord gateway.

- `GatewayIntentBits.Guilds`: Allows the bot to receive events related to server activities, such as role updates,
  channel creations, and deletions.
- `GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages`: Enables the bot to receive events related to messages sent in guild text channels,
  including message creation, updates, and deletions.
- `GatewayIntentBits.MessageContent`: Permits the bot to access the content of messages (`message.content`).
- `GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessageReactions`: Allows the bot to receive events related to message reactions, such as when
  someone reacts to a message.

## Partials

It is possible for some Discord events (such as messages, reactions, etc.) to be not fully cached, meaning the bot may
not receive the complete data. Partials allow the bot to handle these events even with incomplete data.

- `Partials.Message`: For handling the messages events that are not fully cached.
- `Partials.Channel`: For handling the channal events that are not fully cached.
- `Partials.Reaction`: For handling the reaction events that are not fully cached.
